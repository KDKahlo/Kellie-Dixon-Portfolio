🚀 Live

This project is a web application that showcases a personal portfolio and projects section. It features a responsive navigation bar, an about me section, and a projects section to display the creator's work. Additionally, there is an admin access functionality that can be toggled to grant special privileges. The application is designed to provide an interactive and visually appealing experience for users to explore the developer's portfolio.

🔍 Keywords: Vue.js, CSS3, HTML5, Vite, Git, responsive design.

🟡 Version 1
After seeing countless WordPress and Elementor templates, I made the decision to design my own project from scratch and implement it. This project was created to showcase my work, practice Vue.js, and serve as a replacement for a task in the FullStack Development Bootcamp I was attending at the time. That's why it has a login feature, but the changes made using it are not permanent.

🌱 Next version: I'll remove the login feature since it was just practice rendering components.
👾 Bugs: None that I know of! But if you find one, please let me know.
