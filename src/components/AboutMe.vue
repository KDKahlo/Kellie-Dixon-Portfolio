    <p class="about-me-text">
      Hi there! I'm a former <span class="white-highlight">soldier</span>,
      <span class="white-highlight">billing supervisor</span>,
      <span class="white-highlight">teacher</span>, and now a
      <span class="white-highlight">full-stack developer</span> based in Berlin. My diverse
      background has shaped me into a versatile team player who thrives on problem-solving and
      innovation. Teaching abroad fueled my passion for technology, inspiring me to develop apps
      like <span class="aqua-highlight">AleYea CraftbeerMe!</span> and
      <span class="aqua-highlight">Homework Homies</span>. Recently, I completed a
      <span class="white-highlight">Fullstack Bootcamp at CodeOp</span>, which deepened my interest
      in backend development and sparked numerous app ideas. I'll be starting
      <span class="white-highlight">AWS Cloud training</span>
      in July and am excited about joining a team where I can grow and contribute as a full-stack
      developer. I'm particularly interested in roles that align with my long-term goal of advancing
      <span class="white-highlight">EdTech</span>, but I am open to exploring all full stack
      opportunities.
    </p>

    <p class="projects-intro">
      <span class="aqua-highlight">Do you want to see my projects? </span>
      <span class="white-highlight">You're already checking out one with this portfolio!</span>
      But there's more to explore - keep scrolling down to discover what else I've been working on.
